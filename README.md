# SuperDARN Data processing
This repository provides detailed guidance on the processing of Super Dual Auroral Network (SuperDARN) data using the Radar Software Toolkit (RST), available at: https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst

Helpful documentation for RST, including installation instructions, descriptions of standard SuperDARN data formats, and introductory data processing tutorials, can be found in the RST readthedocs pages: https://radar-software-toolkit-rst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The goal of this repository is to bring together the main processing steps outlined in the original RST documentation and explain them in greater detail, with a focus on clarity for new SuperDARN users.
